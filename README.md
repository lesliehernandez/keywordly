## Overview
Keywordly is a web app that allows marketers to perform keyword research with just a few clicks, eliminating the need for tedious spreadsheets.

The user signs in and creates a new project by entering their Project Name and Website URL. Once the project is created the user can view their dashboard which provides a high level overview of website performance. The user can also create a report by clicking the "Create Report" button. This will take the user to the Domain Overview page view with an overview of their website traffic. The user can enter their "branded" keywords and can add "keyword brackets" to view a detail table of their keyword data. Finally the user can generate their report and export their file as a CSV!
